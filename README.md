# bioNER
This project focuses on implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER), a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). NER involves identifying and classifying named entities—such as people, organizations, locations, and specialized terms—within text. In this case, the task is applied to a biomedical corpus, which includes entities like diseases, drugs, genes, and other biomedical terms.

To achieve this, a BERT model is fine-tuned on a biomedical-specific dataset, allowing it to accurately classify various biomedical entities. This fine-tuned model helps in extracting valuable information from vast biomedical datasets, which can be critical for tasks such as medical research, drug discovery, and clinical data analysis.
